<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrical Test Pencil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type Test Pencil</li><li>Induction Type Test Pencil</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>In the electrical industry, two common types of test pencils are contact type and induction type. Contact type test pencils are equipped with a metal probe that needs to be physically touched to a live wire or electrical component to determine its presence or absence of voltage. On the other hand, induction type test pencils use electromagnetic fields to detect the presence or absence of voltage without making direct contact with the circuit. Both types serve the same purpose of ensuring electrical safety by indicating the presence or absence of voltage in various situations.</p></p>
