<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sunscreens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Sunscreens</li><li>Physical Sunscreens</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Chemical sunscreens refer to products that use chemical compounds such as avobenzone and oxybenzone to absorb and convert UV radiation into heat, ultimately preventing it from reaching the skin. On the other hand, physical sunscreens, also known as mineral sunscreens, contain active mineral ingredients like titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, which act as a physical barrier by reflecting and scattering UV radiation away from the skin's surface. Both types of sunscreens offer protection against the sun's harmful rays, but they differ in terms of the active ingredients used and their mechanism of action.</p></p>
